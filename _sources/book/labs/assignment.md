# Module Assignment

This assignment not only tests your understanding of FAIR principles but also encourages you to think critically about data management in your research context.

**Office hours** I will be online but in the Central time zone but I encourage anyone who wants to to reach out for section as needed on slack or setup some dedicated time with me and I am happy to add something on our calendars.

## Part 1: Evaluating an Existing Dataset for FAIR Principles

Create a 1-2 page document for this section, make sure you include citation and relevant links. You can post the link to the google doc or the actual documents in the #assignment-submission channel and tag me using @Samapriya Roy

### Task:
1. **Search and Find a Dataset:** Locate an existing dataset of your choice. It could be related to your research interests or any topic that intrigues you.

2. **Evaluate FAIR Principles:** Assess whether the dataset follows the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Provide evidence to support your evaluation.

3. **Recommendations:** If the dataset doesn't fully comply with FAIR principles, suggest improvements or changes that could make it more FAIR. If it does, highlight what makes it an ideal example of adhering to these principles.

```{note}
 Please submit your evaluation of the existing dataset and your Data Management Plan section as separate documents.
```

## Part 2: Crafting a Data Management Plan for Your Research Proposal

Create a 1-2 page document for this section, google is a friend and you can find examples of existing data management plan. You can post the link to the google doc or the actual documents in the #assignment-submission channel and tag me using @Samapriya Roy

### Task:
1. **Reflect on FAIR Principles:** Based on your experience in Part 1 and your class learnings, consider the importance of FAIR principles in data management.

2. **Data Management Plan (DMP):** Use this knowledge to craft a section of a Data Management Plan for a research proposal you are developing. Think about:
   - How you will make your data findable and accessible.
   - Measures to ensure your data is interoperable and reusable.
   - Addressing any challenges you foresee in adhering to FAIR principles.

3. **Consider the 'Where' of Data:** Use Amelia's discussions on the 'where' of data that is upcoming and my discussion on Google Earth Engine. Reflect on the most suitable platforms and repositories where your data will be hosted or published.
