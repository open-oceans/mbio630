# awesome-gee-community-catalog

The [awesome-gee-community-catalog](https://gee-community-catalog.org/) is a repository of community-sourced geospatial datasets created for the benefit of the broader Google Earth Engine community. These datasets are made publicly available as Earth Engine assets. The project was initiated to address the common challenge of research datasets often requiring preprocessing before they can be used directly. This catalog complements the [Google Earth Engine data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog) and hosts datasets frequently requested by the community, which are offered under various open licenses.

For a deeper understanding of the project's history and its inception, you can refer to the [Medium Post article here](https://medium.com/geospatial-processing-at-scale/community-datasets-data-commons-in-google-earth-engine-8585d8baef1f).
